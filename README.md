Intro
Our team, SHE Builts have built a SHE Wins website specifically for females and is built by females, services provided are in below section.
We are the Dr. Tech’s builders.


The problem it solves 
Over 2 billion people are suffering and 150,000 people die every single day from diseases, which if known timely can be prevented. There is 50X growth in Health Data + 3,50,000 Digital Heath, but still life expectancy is declining. The major reason behind it is that Collaboration & data sharing is punished in the market and we are paying $157 billion to programmers for writing the similar code for online (AI) doctor. We have tried to bring all under one roof, one platform, which separately exists but are not commonly used. Under Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission, an agency of the Government of India, aims to develop the backbone necessary to support the integrated digital health infrastructure of the country. Dr. will be a future brand name in the medical field.

Female problems are the topic people are still ashamed to discuss about, here our website is made for women to openly discuss the problems they face by
Writing blogs and get knowledge from blogs we provide
Period tracker which can period nxt 2-3 months dates so that females can plan accordingly. 
Donation option is also provided so that we can add market place for sanitary pads and hygiene stuff for women in village who still use antique methods which result in infections.
Add reminder option is available to fix healthy schedule habits.

After getting traffic on website, females will be able to keep track of their monthly cycle to avoid ignorance and get early predictions of diseases like Breast Cancer, PCOS etc. [my research paper on CAD PCOS prediction using ML-http://www.ijpe-online.com/EN/10.23940/ijpe.23.03.p5.193202 ]


       Symptom Checker
Every minute Google gets over 70,000 health-related searches. This amounts to 7 percent of Google’s daily queries. In most cases, people try to find out the possible cause of their symptoms and understand what to do next. But end in depression by concluding the result as death.
Dr. Tech tells the disease by taking symptoms as inputs (based on API call) and age, gender
Predicts the possible disease with chances of all possible ones.
For less educated people it has body map by clicking on which we will get options of possible symptoms
It gives a detailed treatment report for possible disease and suggests behavior.


      Skin Cancer detection App
ML based android app built using JAVA and XML
ML model trained on benign and malignant skin type using CNN (convolutional neutral network)
Deep learning model has been built to classify and identify the binary diagnostic group of melanocytic images obtained through dermoscopy.
A benign growth is non-cancerous, typically develops slowly, and doesn't spread to other parts of the body. A malignant growth, on the other hand, is cancerous, can grow rapidly, and, in some cases, can spread to tissues in other parts of the body
App has two options of uploading an image or capturing directly from the camera. It predicts the type of skin disease.


              Depression Special Treatment
Peer to Peer chat option available to users.
Connecting to peers who have suffered from such a situation which is causing depression can help you get the right path timely.
Our website provides booking appointment options free of cost but peers can ask for a fee for consultation.


      Tracking of medicines using blockchain
 Blockchain is the decentralized ledger, which records and protects transaction data shared among multiple parties
 Allows infinite and anonymous parties to conduct transactions without the need for an intermediary. 
The focus is on allowing a set number of known parties to conduct transactions with one another directly while improving security, ensuring contract compliance and reducing costs. 
Supply chain blockchains "tokenize" a variety of transaction-related data, creating unique and readily verifiable identifiers
Every participant in the chain has their own unique digital signature, which is used to "sign" tokens moving through the chain.
 Every phase of a given transaction is recorded in the transfers between stakeholders, providing a built-in audit trail 
Everyone gets their own copy of the chain. 
A bad actor tinkering with their own chain would also have to find a way to make the same changes to subsequent links in the copies maintained by everyone else.
           Working of pharma chain :
Smart contracts are used to build trust between parties
following registration procedure of stakeholders is done by the owner of the smart contract
Contact deployed using ganache interface
Medicines ordered only by using owner of smart contract, if any other person tries to do it il show error
After ordering the medicines , each medicine will get unique id which is further used for tracking
Each stakeholder will perform its role in each step of supply chain
Using this we are able to get current status of supply chain
We are also able to track the medicine by its unique id
